"﻿Y'all smell like corndogs. Roll Tide!". The overly obese  Alabama fan said as he walked away from a tent where he had just snagged a bowl of gumbo. "I don't smell like corn dogs - why'd he say we smelt like corndogs?" I asked 'Tiger Mike', my newly found tailgating buddy. I wasn't sure if people started calling him that because I did, or if he was serious when he told me that was his swinger party name.

"Go on 'own to zi bathtoob and scoop you some of dis Tigerjoose!" Tiger Mike pointed over to his camper - he really did just suggest that I go scoop up a purple glass of grain liquor (Everclear), bourbon, Rolling Rock, and purple Kool Aid. He could see the look of disgust on my face and chuckled, "Oh no no mi oh my-oh, c'est la vie. It's just a liquor tub and I aint never washed a human in there or nuttin!" Ugh, I slink over to the bath tub and prepare to swallow a lost toe nail or pluck out a long hair from my gullet. But none of that happened - it was in fact the greatest liquor drink I ever had.

I﻿ also was drunk for the next two days after that. Best night of my life.
