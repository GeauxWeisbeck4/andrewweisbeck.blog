# S﻿uper Frustrated with Netlify

I have never been so mad in my life about a product that I love so much. I really love Netlify, but I almost am so upset that I want to quit using it. It sounds impossible to do that, but this has been unacceptable. Here's the biggest catch of it all - NOBODY HAS HELPED ME SOLVE MY PROBLEM AND ITS BEEN WEEKS!

# Why are you so mad Andrew?

W﻿ell here is why I'm mad - this all started when I added my co-partner to our Netlify dashboard. I noticed the next day i was charged a bill. It wasn't odd considering I had Pro but I was pretty sure that I get a free business plan with up to 5 workers as a Netlify Partner. I inquired by sending an email to the support team, hoping to get good news from the partner team.

W﻿ell it didn't come from the partner team, but from the support team who didn't even acknowledge my partner status and just continued on with telling me "NON ON NONO NO! YOU MUST PAY! NOW!" I calmly reasserted my position and the at support staff member never responded. So I decided to just update my card anyways and if the payment hits while, I'll talk to the partner team and get it resolved.

## H﻿ere's the real angering

S﻿o time goes by and I keep noticing the bill IS NOT GETTING PAID... I wonder, hmm? That's weird. I keep asking for them to charge it by updating my card and sending a message... no paid bill. Well its now cost me a client because the last two days I have not been able to get to my dashboard and show this client a website. I again am trying to put a card loaded with money (not a lot loaded, but loaded with enough money). Well it's still not working and I am pissed off Netlify.

G﻿et your shit together! I need to see my websites.
