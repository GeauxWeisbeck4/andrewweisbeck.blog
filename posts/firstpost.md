The first version of my personal blog site, [andrewweisbeck.blog](https://andrewweisbeck.blog), wasn't really publicized much by myself or others. I felt that my writing was maybe "too personal to share with the masses" - stupid excuse and wrong.

The real answer is that I was too afraid of sharing my writing with the fears of somebody saying "YOU SUCK!" or that it might prevent me from getting a job. That hasn't happened either really so what's the excuse now? There is none!

## What to expect from Version 2

Version 2 of andrewweisbeck.blog will have a much more elegant style and also will be a continual work in progress as far as developing it goes. I plan to have themed templates that match certain seasons, holidays, and more! I want to keep the blog fun and alive to keep the readers engaged and entertained!
