# F﻿uck Hackmamba and their stupid Hackathon

Y﻿eah fuck em - I was going to submit the winning project (HuskerJS.dev as you can see above) but they closed their submission time 4 hours before midnight eastern time, the usual cut off time of hackathons. Or at least from what I understood. You know what they said to me after I realized I couldn't get it in on time?

> S﻿ubmit it so we can review it! You have to finish what you started!

A﻿ctually, no. Fuck that! Y'all wanted me to submit it so you can have free content for your hackathon fucking assholes. You could have still accepted mine because of the misunderstanding and allowed me to be considered for the project like other hackathons always do. You were just scared that I was gonna win so you didn't let me submit it so you could let your favorites win. I won't elaborate any more on that, but fuck you Hack Mamba!
