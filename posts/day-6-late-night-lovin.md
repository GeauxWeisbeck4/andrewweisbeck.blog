"I'm gonna find my baby gonna hold her tight lookin for some Late Night Delight!"

 No, no, no. That's not what this post is about. 

It's about true love at midnight on a Thursday night. It's been a hard year for my fiance of a year and a half (Lisa) and myself. I won't spin off into all the details but let's take a glimpse of my day today. 

9:00 AM - I wake up to my hip flexors cramping. I can't sleep any longer even though I've only slept three hours. I can't sleep because of the stress of not having a job for almost a year. 

9:01AM-5PM Among the things that happen in this time period: 

* My computers continually crash, losing my work multiple times.
* Animals distract me from completing my Hackathon project for three hours which is due today (they just changed the date in a change of fortune).
* Magnolia shits diahrrea 3 FUCKING TIMES all over the apartment.
* My web project I work on all day is lost when my computer crashes. One of the cats also unplugs my Raspberry Pi crashing my project.
* I make no progress on work and Lisa and I have no answer about how to pay the bills.
* Lisa and I decide to give ourselves a break and go attempt to purhcase two $11 gyros at the food truck in our apartment parking lot - he charges $2 extra for tax and credit card - ok, I only have $23.81 on my card and he's charging me $24 and my card keeps getting declined. People in line are looking at me as I try to figure out how to come up with $0.19 to pay for the two gyros and its embarassing

Here is where something changed for us. This is something that almost never happens to us. A nice lady sees we are struggling and pays for our gyros. I want to break into tears but we graciously thank her - god bless her. She has no idea how  much this means to us. We are both very hungry as we have spent our food stamps and don't have much for solid food in the house. 

I find out that my interview for my job on Monday will be for a job that has a $60k salary. That is so wonderful - I also have all weekend to prepare. I finally feel like there is hope for our situation.

# Late Night Lovin

So Lisa is a wonderful human being and very selfless. I accompany her to walk down the dangerous Glenwood Avenue to Crabtree Valley Mall so she doesn't have to walk through the dark alone with cars hurtling through the night sky while we are just inches away from them on the side of the road. Lisa is bringing two pairs of steel toe boots to a homeless couple because one of them needs them for her Amazon job tomorrow. She also brings health supplies from her job because she knows one of them is very sick. It's an hour and a half long escapade, bringing us home covered in sweat and lucky no car hits us. But we get to talk about positive things and just feel grateful for each other.

I've been really bad about being stressed and throwing myself into work and I rarely ever sleep in the bed. Lisa and I just lay in bed for hours without saying a word, but completely content despite this shit-fuck of a year that has kicked our tired asses up and down bullshit road. I have applied for over 1,000 jobs since losing my job last year due to a false failed drug test while on probation (I did the honest thing and told them what was happening and they just fired me - the charges are dropped when I go to court because they are not accurate and I have shown good behavior and I get off probation early) and I have participated in probably 40-50 interviews and I have not had a job since.

I have been suicidal, angry, and even at times just flat out despondent. We have suffered so many financial set backs and then add the fact that Lisa earns $2,000 a month as our only income and you have two exhausted human beings who are just at the end of their final straw. I haven't gotten into 1/10th of the story of 2021-2022, but I will say this - we've been through so much together in the last two years that we've experienced things that couples who have been married forever don't ever have to experience. Except take that couple and multiply it by 10. 

We don't say anything for hours, but we are both awake just cuddled together and both of us have the same feeling - unconditional love. We don't have to speak to understand that the other feels exactly the same thing in that moment. We understand what we've been through, but that doesn't matter as we are just existing with eachother and completely blotting out the horrible things we've put up with in life these last two years. We understand the other person will always be there and that's all that matters - not even our worst days can tear the immensely strong bond of love from us. Both of us know that we could lose everything, the clothes on our backs even, and nothing else would matter but being together.

It feels as each day that it is harder to get out of bed to do battle (when I do go to bed that is). But I just have to look over at the beautiful, amazing human who I am so lucky to share my life with every day to know that I have to do it for her. She is getting up to go to work to support us and I understand how much emotional pain she is in as well and that she needs me the same as I need her to continue on with each day that seems to grow more difficult and depressing as I get further away from my last day of work.

We just laid there tonight and felt peace in a time that peace is very rare for us. I know it seems like a stupid story or just like something irrelevant to blogging about, but I say this because we have something that so many people do not have: unconditional love that knows no bounds. It's nothing complex, its quite simple - but it is the deepest and most powerful feeling that man knows. 

We're not perfect, we may be poor, and we may be homeless if things don't turn around. But we don't ever have to worry about anything when we are just sharing some 'Late Night Lovin' with the only person that we care to be around. 

Life is a beautiful thing with you Lisa - thank you for sharing your heart with mine.
