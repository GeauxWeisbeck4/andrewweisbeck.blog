S﻿tarting a new habit is always challenging. It's always felt especialply hard for me, especially with my already short attention span and ADHD brain. One habit I've never been able to maintain that I want to change for good is my daily blogging. I don't just mean writing, blogging - why? Because I write everyday just fine - it's the sharing with other people that I need to work on.t

R﻿ead on to learn more about how I intend to do this!

## I﻿ am going to begin blogging daily, starting today

I﻿ often get frustrated when I see only a few clicks on my Medium blog posts. I've had my Medium account for a couple years and consider myself a fairly entertaining writer, but I still am not pulling in enough traffic and/or views when I really know I should be doing better. The only reason I have not been more successful in my blogging in terms of views, money, and reputation is because I am not publishing as much of my writing as I should. I'm writing **a lot** everyday, but I am keeping it all to myself and that's just stupid and selfish.

P﻿art of it is my insecurities, another part of it is my own procrastination. Sometimes I fear how my writing will be received and other times I find out the day is over by the time I pull up my blogging platform of choice. I have a plan to solve these two critical problems:

#### 1﻿. Blog at the beginning of the day on this blog

T﻿hat solves the problem of procrastination and starting by blogging here will at least get something published and out on the internet immediately.

#### 2﻿. Post everyday no matter what

I﻿t sounds like a simple solution - because it really is. This will have content out there that people can read. It will help me get over my insecurities if I see people interacting with my writing. I'll also be able to read it and see how I can make my writing better before I go publish somewhere else.

## U﻿sing the "Golden Rule" from The Power of Habit

T﻿his is a wonderful book about starting new habits and changing old ones. The 3rd chapter of the book talks about changing habits. We want to keep the same cues, same reward, but change the behavior when we decide to change. So the cues will be there in the morning - I'll pull up my LogSeq notes and start my To Do List - it will automatically start with write blog post and then I will write that post. The reward will be seeing it published worldwide - this always gives me a little endorphin rush!

T﻿hat is how I plan on doing this! Now, here is a little run down on what's going on with my day.
