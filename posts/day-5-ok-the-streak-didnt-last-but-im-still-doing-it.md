summary: To be fair, I was sick in bed, shivering in an icy cold sweat the past
  few days and I couldn't sit up straight without almost passing out. But I
  ain't giving up on my new habit!

# I﻿ knew my streak wouldn't last... feels kinda good it ended so soon

T﻿he important lesson in all of this is that I persevered through all the chaos and turmoil and I am here at my keyboard, bringing y'all a slice of Andrew's chunky dictionary,  carefully laid out on your home screen so you can savor every ounce of literacy that I have to share with you. 

I﻿ don't know if it was chaos and turmoil really - I'm being dramatic because I can't breath out my nose and I feel like I chain smoked a pack of Backwoodz cigars, yet I haven't smoked in a week. I really didn't have a chance to blog when I was sick, which was ok. You know, you can't always be perfect and that's what I want to show everyone - I'M NOT PERFECT!

B﻿ut I'm kinda really back on my grind with everything. I still can't fucking land a steady income though for the life of me and its really just making me wonder if the pandemic a﻿ctually killed off my ability to earn money. I've applied for over 1,000 jobs since November, been told I've basically had at least three of them, only to have the employer change their mind, and sat through so many interviews that I really appreciate it when somebody is just honest with me instead of leading me on.

G﻿RRR - I need a refreshing deep breath of air...

## I'm a good developer and promise I can code!

I﻿ just don't know how else to get people to give me a chance. I promise I can code JavaScript, React, Python, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and much more. While I've been programming for a few years sorta part time, the last year has been an absolute devotion to my practice with me spending like 6 days a week, working about 12-15 hours a day, learning how to code and seeking new opportunities. 

***D﻿oesn't it seem like something should have worked out by now?*** 

I﻿t just gets harder by the day telling my partner to "trust me, I'm almost there". It's hard to keep dealing with all the rejection with NO wins. I have a lot of cool projects going, but I don't have the money to sustain my life or sustain these ideas because I'm caught in a whirlwind of ADHD mixed with Stress and being absolutely broke - always facing eviction cause I can't land a job. Will we get evicted twice this year?

## L﻿et's make a deal... well I'm just gonna tell you about my plan

S﻿o I have a lot of different publications I'm creating right now. I'm going to render them all on this blog page so there is a central hub to all of my content. That way, y'all can document all the work I'm doing and decided if I'm working hard enough to donate to my cause. If you like a project and want to help fund it, be my guest - I promise the most money will dictate what I work on and the speed and quality in how I achieve it. I have a lot of links that will be rendered and have to make a links page at <https://geauxweisbeck4.dev/links> for now.

I﻿'ll try to get my sites and blogs and everything listed in a central hub and a way that y'all can help me help you achieve your dreams.

U﻿ntil next time!
