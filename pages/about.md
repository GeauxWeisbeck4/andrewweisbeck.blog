Hello! Thank you for stopping by my blog website to explore, read my blog posts, or try to get a hold of me. I hope you have found something that you enjoy in my collection of posts or at least enjoyed something about the website in general. I didn't completely build this one from scratch - see below - but I did have the final say in the design as well as the final say in each post.

Now for a few things about myself - I'm a 31 year old freelance full-stack developer who lives in Raleigh, NC with my fiance Lisa, our two cats, and one dog. As a family, we spend a lot of time either outdoors or reading and working. Our plan is to travel around the nation in a small van or school bus type thing we would renovate. I like to ski, so hopefully our adventures would revolve around that.

If you are looking for more Portfolio project type stuff, notes, my resume - you need to visit my main Web Dev website [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev). It is likely that you will find whatever it is you are looking for on that page.

## What technology was used to make this website?

This website was created with love and and care, using the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev) - my favorite by the way - and the [Netlify Content Management System](https://www.netlifycms.org). The form uses Netlify Forms, which can be found on the [Netlify website](https://www.netlify.com), which reminds me to tell you that I used Netlify to deploy this website.

I've gotta give credit to [Dan Urbanowicz](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/) for the simple boilerplate he provided to get me started with an easy to use layout and already integrated Netlify CMS - which makes my life SOOOO much easier. Thank you Dan! Go visit his repository page and star the shit [out of this repo](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate).
