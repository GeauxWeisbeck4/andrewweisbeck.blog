# Welcome to My Personal Blog

This is the official andrewweisbeck.blog - it's basically my personal blog that I post daily rants, research and other fun things I like to write about like psychology, business, sports and computer science. I am a very curious human and love to learn, so you will often catch my blog posts about things I'm currently learning or curious about.

If you have any questions or want to suggest a topic, collaborate, or just say hi, you can go to my contact page and fill out the form and I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.
